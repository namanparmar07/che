                <h3>From top leaders of UNEP around the United Nations on 8th of nov 2023</h3>
                <p>The 2023 Production Gap report is a startling indictment of runaway climate carelessness. It reveals that governments are on track to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be needed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
   <p>In other words, governments are literally doubling down on fossil fuel production; that spells double trouble for people and planet.  
 
    We cannot address climate catastrophe without tackling its root cause: fossil fuel dependence. Fossil fuel emissions are already causing climate chaos which is devastating lives and livelihoods, and we’re on course for far worse.   
     </p> 
     <p>Leaders must act now to save humanity from the worst impacts of climate chaos, and profit from the extraordinary benefits of renewable energy. That means ending our fossil fuel addiction by shrinking supply, driving down demand, and accelerating the renewables revolution, as part of a just transition. </p>
     <h3>INTERVIEWS</h3>
    
     <p>The United Nations and broader multilateral system bring together some of the world's leading thinkers on climate change — scientists, diplomats, economists and entrepreneurs as well as activists, youth and civil society leaders, who make invaluable contributions to the global climate movement. Learn more about their vision, drive and expertise through these in-depth conversations.</p>
